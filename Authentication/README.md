## :page_facing_up: About

This is a simple project made to understand how Authentication works in React. The App consists in a simple Page where the user can 
Sign Up, Sign In and Sign Out. If the user is authenticated he can acess the Feature page, where there's just a text displayed. 
It has no styles because the goal is to learn about Middlewares with Redux.

In this application there is a server to store the register information of the client and to check the auth of the User.
